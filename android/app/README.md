A sample Android application to play a vide stream and to load SIMID creatives.

This sample appplication displays SIMID creatives from triggers from the Broadpeak [SmartLib agent](https://delivery-platform.broadpeak.tv/smartlib/).

The playback is achieved using the open-source project [androidx media](https://github.com/androidx/media).

This application is using the SIMID controller from this project [android/controller](../controller), which needs to be built before running the application.
